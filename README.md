# artistic-funding-and-employment-baltimore
This study analyzes how the amount of artistic funding in a Baltimore neighborhood impacts the number of employed creative people.

## Background

Baltimore is home to a thriving arts community. Institutions like the Maryland Institute College of Art and programs like Artscape have propelled the city to the [#10 spot of the nation’s top arts destinations.](https://www.greaterbaltimore.org/news/blog/importance-arts-economic-development). Proponents of these programs [argue](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-mica-hoi-20151227-story.html) that art can promote community cohesion, foster character growth in young people, and beautify neighborhoods. Given the strength of the Baltimore arts economy and its benefit to communities, we should investigate what conditions this sector thrives under and how resources are currently being distributed. Considering that [most arts businesses are small businesses](https://www.arts.gov/stories/blog/2020/taking-note-monitoring-role-freelancers-and-small-businesses-arts-economy-and-early-signs-covid-19), we should also investigate Baltimore’s small business economy.
