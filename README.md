# artistic-funding-and-employment-baltimore
This study analyzes how the amount of artistic funding in a Baltimore neighborhood impacts the number of employed creative people.

## Background

Baltimore is home to a thriving arts community. Institutions like the Maryland Institute College of Art and programs like Artscape have propelled the city to the [#10 spot of the nation’s top arts destinations.](https://www.greaterbaltimore.org/news/blog/importance-arts-economic-development). Proponents of these programs [argue](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-mica-hoi-20151227-story.html) that art can promote community cohesion, foster character growth in young people, and beautify neighborhoods. Given the strength of the Baltimore arts economy and its benefit to communities, we should investigate what conditions this sector thrives under and how resources are currently being distributed. Considering that [most arts businesses are small businesses](https://www.arts.gov/stories/blog/2020/taking-note-monitoring-role-freelancers-and-small-businesses-arts-economy-and-early-signs-covid-19), we should also investigate Baltimore’s small business economy.

## Business Questions

What is the relationship between small business funding and the number of young, small businesses in Baltimore? 

What is the relationship between small business funding and the arts employment rate in Baltimore? How does this relationship vary between neighborhoods? 

## Datasets

All data was taken from Baltimore City Open Data. They can be downloaded from our GitHub repository, or found at the following links: 

[Total Dollar Amount Invested in Small Businesses per 50 Businesses](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/bniajfi::total-dollar-amount-invested-in-small-businesses-per-50-businesses?geometry=-77.142%2C39.192%2C-76.099%2C39.378&page=6&selectedAttribute=Shape__Length)

This data gives the total dollar amount invested in small businesses per 50 businesses in every community statistical area in Baltimore for the years 2016 through 2019.

[Percent of Businesses that are 2 Years old or less](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/bniajfi::percent-of-businesses-that-are-2-years-old-or-less-1?geometry=-77.142%2C39.192%2C-76.099%2C39.378)

This data gives the percent of businesses in every community statistical area in Baltimore that are 2 years old or less for the years 2010 through 2019. 

[Total Employment in Arts Related Businesses](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/bniajfi::total-employment-in-arts-related-businesses/data?page=2)

This data gives the number of employed persons in arts related businesses in every community statistical area in Baltimore for the years 2010 through 2018.

This data gives the population of each community statistical area from the 2010 Census. Though we generally look at data from 2016 in this study, the Census only occurs every 10 years and 2020 Census data has not yet been released, so this population data is the most up to date data we have.

## Methods
